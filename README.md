The JanBan Outlook Taskboard is a kanban board style view for Outlook Tasks.

This project is based on [Evren varol's Outlook Taskboard](https://github.com/evrenvarol/outlook-taskboard).
I have added a lot of features, customization and configuration options.

### Platforms supported
Only tested with Outlook 2013 and 2016 running on Windows 8.1/10.
It may also work with earlier Outlook versions, and possibly work with Windows 7.

The taskboard can also be opened in Internet Explorer. Due to limitations with ActiveX controls, only Internet Explorer 9/10 and 11 are supported.
